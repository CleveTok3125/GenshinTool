# ⚠️Attention
- Although the new API is supported, the features are not yet fully tested. If you encounter any errors, please feed back in issue.
- Currently the audio patcher only supports Genshin Impact. For other games, download the client and audio zip file and update via launcher. **DO NOT COPY CONTENTS IN THE ZIP FILE DIRECTLY TO GAME DIRECTORY**.
- I'm working on an audio patcher for Zenless Zone Zero but it hasn't worked yet. To use the stable version, download it via [releases](https://github.com/CleveTok3125/MHY/releases)
